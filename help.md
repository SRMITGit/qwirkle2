### Helpful Tips

- Try to add a tile that forms more than one line to score double points.
- Avoid creating lines that have 5 tiles because your opponents will add the 6th tile to score a Qwirkle.
- The worst thing you can do is hold an identical pair of tiles in your deck. i.e. two squares
- If you cannot get any productive play of more than four points from your rack, then you will want to consider an exchange.
- Use small two-tile combos to block certain possible Qwirkles.
